# Karma Mocha Example

This repository is a test project intended to be used for debugging [Angular/Karma Test Explorer](https://github.com/Raagh/angular-karma_test-explorer). This extension works well with Jasmine tests, but fails to load Mocha tests as used in this project.

## Run the project

1. Restore dependencies using `npm ci`
2. Run the Karma tests using `npm run test`
3. Run the Mocha tests using `npm run test:mocha`
